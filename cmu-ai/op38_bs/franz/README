This directory contains Franz Lisp Opus 38.92 (the last public domain
release), as modified by Barry Schein for the Sun-3.  The sources should
work on the Sun-2 and other machines as well.

The pre-compiled .s files are not distributed on the Sun User Group
tape, since they can be regenerated in a few hours on a Sun.
We are not sure of the copyright status of the 'lispas' sources,
so for now they are not on the tape either.

When configuring the system, specify "./lispconf sun_4_2".

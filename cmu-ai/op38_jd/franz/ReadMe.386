This is a distribution of Franz Lisp, Opus 38.92 for NetBSD 0.9
running on 386 and 486 PCs.  With minor changes, it should also be
able to run under 386BSD and FreeBSD.

The compile-to-C compiler and the version of fasl that goes with it
were developed by Jeff Dalton <J.Dalton@ed.ac.uk>.  Some of the
OS-related and numeric code was written by Richard Tobin.

If you root this source tree in /usr/local/src/franz, you should be
able to build Franz Lisp by typing "make slow".  If you already have
working versions of "lisp" and "liszt" in /usr/local/src/franz/bin/,
you should be able to make new versions by typing "make fast".

If these directories are not the ones you're using, you can edit
the top-level Makefile to change them.  You may also have to edit
lisplib/lisztcc, and maybe some other things.

Instead of editing the Makefile, it should work to type

   ./lispconf i386_4_3:
   make slow

Note that "lisp" in the source root directory is a symbolic link to ".".
This is an artifact of the way things were set up at some point in the
past.  It would be easy enough to eliminate it, but I haven't had time
to make sure nothing depends on it.  However, the only dependency I
know about is on lisplib/lisztcc.

You will probably have to make /usr/local/lib/lisp be or point to
the lisp library directory (lisplib in the sources).
